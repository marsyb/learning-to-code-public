<h2>Top 3 lesbian coded cate blanchett movies</h2>

<h3>Carol</h3>
<p>She here, she's with Rooney Mara and it's christmastime.<br />
    A cute queer holiday movie that's sure to break your heart. 10/10 for no one dying and there being an ambigously but promising happy ending</p>
<h3>Tar</h2>
<p>It may have won awards, but did it win our hearts? Not sure. She had a wife who it felt like she was kind of mean too, but her wife did exist. 7/10.</p>
<h3>Ocean's 8</h3>
<p>Sure, there was no direct pointing to her sexuality but the pant suits were on fire. 8/10 for the pantsuits alone.</p>
